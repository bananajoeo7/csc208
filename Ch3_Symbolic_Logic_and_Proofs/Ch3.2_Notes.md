## Discrete Math Symbolic Logic and Proofs Chapter 3.2:
### There are infinitely many primes (proof by contradiction):
First, we assume that the statement is false and that there is a finite amount of 
prime numbers. Therefore there has to be the largest prime number P and consider the
following: \
$$N = p! + 1 = (p * (p - 1) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1) + 1$$

This shows that N is certainly larger than p. Also, N is not divisible by any
number less than or equal to p, since every number less than or equal to
p divides p!. Therefore the prime factorization of N contains prime numbers
all greater than p. So p is not the largest prime, a contradiction. 
Therefore there are infinitely many primes.

### Direct Proof:
definition: It is the simplest form of a proof, all it does is explain each element
of a statement, and making the statement more obvious to understand in turn proving
the statement.

### Proof by Contrapositive:
Essentially what this method allows you to do is look at the statement from a 
different angle, and then proceed to do a direct proof, as a contrapositive is 
logically equivalent to the original statement.
